Jul 2025 – Aug 2025



– Designed a semantic code search pipeline that integrates Gemini-cloud and GraphCodeBERT embeddings with Chroma vector database and Qwen3-14B LLM fro different needs (One is free and privacy-friendly but less accurate and slower; the other is multilingual and more accurate but paid and less private.)


– Developed a LLM-powered coding assistant based on RAG, enabling semantic code search and programming guidance generating
